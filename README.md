Here's a solution to problem #5, found [here](https://www.shiftedup.com/2015/05/07/five-programming-problems-every-software-engineer-should-be-able-to-solve-in-less-than-1-hour):

> Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 (in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100.

I found 11.

I went about it using:
* TDD
* recursion
* starting with smaller version of the problem.

Take a look at
* the git history to see how it progressed (my design changed a lot at the beginning, and continued to change throughout)
* the tests to see how to use it and what it can do.
